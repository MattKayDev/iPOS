# POS
I was asked to create this POS System for a customer. I have decided to use VB.NET as I was most comfortable with it at the time. 
The customer didn't ask for any security or specifics to be implemented they just wanted an up to date POS system so they could run it on the Windows 10 machine which they have recenetly upgraded to and on which their current POS isn't working. 

So based on the knowledge of their current POS System I have impletemented this simple POS for them which they are using now.
 
# 2023 - Current state of the project
It's January 2023 and project is back alive!
The customer doesn't need to make changes to their current one as they are happy with what they have; however I know that they might eventually ask for a easy way of updating products and prices, or maybe another takeaway might ask for a similar system, I think it will be in my best intrest to make necessary changes to the current project so that the user can make the changes easily without having to access any of the code.
 
 # To do: 
 - Databse to store takeaway info, products users, orders etc.
 - UI to reflect products, reports, orders, users 
 - Export Reports
 - Built in user system

 # Current capabilities from earlier version:
  - Receipt Printing
  - Selecting Collection or Delivery 
  - All other functionality has been deprecated to make way for new and improved versions.
 
 # Extra possible improvements:
  - Possible post code look up
  - Add possibility for the user to add more buttons 
  - Give user option to change the prices
  - Add API to connect to UBER Eats/Deliveroo/JustEat
  - Add possiblity to dial number on the phone by clicking in the app
