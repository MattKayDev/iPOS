# POS
I was asked to create this POS System for a customer. I have decided to use VB.NET as I was most comfortable with it at the time. 
The customer didn't ask for any security or specifics to be implemented they just wanted an up to date POS system so they could run it on the Windows 10 machine which they have recenetly upgraded to and on which their current POS isn't working. 

So based on the knowledge of their current POS System I have impletemented this simple POS for them which they are using now.

09/2021 - Update on the project - After a year I've decided to revisit this project and expand on it. There's a lot that can be done to make this into much better POS System so below I should have everything noted down that's already there and what's to come.

# Current capabilites:
- Place orders (Collection/Delivery)
- Print Receipts 
 
 # Needed To Do:
 - Need to add database so the products, company data etc aren't static and so it can be edited by the user.
 - Implement logging orders so can go back and check the order
 - Export Reports
 - Add users to the system
 
 # Extra possible improvements:
  - Add possibility for the user to add more buttons 
  - Give user option to change the prices
  - Add API to connect to UBER Eats/Deliveroo/JustEat
  - Add possiblity to dial number on the phone by clicking in the app
