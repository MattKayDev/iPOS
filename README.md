# POS
I was asked to create this POS System for a customer. I have decided to use VB.NET as I was most comfortable with it at the time. 
The customer didn't ask for any security or specifics to be implemented they just wanted an up to date POS system so they could run it on the Windows 10 machine which they have recenetly upgraded to and on which their current POS isn't working. 

So based on the knowledge of their current POS System I have impletemented this simple POS for them which they are using now.
 
# 2023 - Current stage of the project
The project is back alive!The customer doesn't need to make changes to their current one as they are happy with what they have however for future proofing and maybe having this POS system used by another takeaway I think it will be best to make it more modern with a database that can be easily changed by the user.
 
 # Things done so far:
 - Access Database has been added so can be easily edited with MS Access but for ease of use I will add extra functionality which will allow the user to add products, edit them, takeaway info in case of multiple sites etc.
 - Logging orders so can go back and check the past order details
 - Export Reports
 - Built in user system
 
 # Extra possible improvements:
  - Possible post code look up
  - Add possibility for the user to add more buttons 
  - Give user option to change the prices
  - Add API to connect to UBER Eats/Deliveroo/JustEat
  - Add possiblity to dial number on the phone by clicking in the app
