# POS
I was asked to create this POS System for a customer. I have decided to use VB.NET as I was most comfortable with it at the time. 
The customer didn't ask for any security or specifics to be implemented they just wanted an up to date POS system so they could run it on the Windows 10 machine which they have recenetly upgraded to and on which their current POS isn't working. 

# Capabilites:
- Place Order Collection/Delivery
- Print Receipts 
 
 # To Do:
 Need to add database so the products, company data etc aren't static and so it can be edited by the user.
 
 # Possible improvements:
  - Add possibility for the user to add more buttons 
  - Give user option to change the prices
  - Add API to connect to UBER Eats/Deliveroo/JustEat
